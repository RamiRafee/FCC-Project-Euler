# Project Euler Solutions

Welcome to my repository dedicated to solving [Project Euler problems from Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/project-euler/)! This collection features my solutions to the various challenging mathematical and computational problems presented in the Project Euler course on Free Code Camp.

## Project Overview

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. This repository contains solutions to the problems I've tackled so far, with more to be added as I continue to work through the challenges.

The problems are divided into several sets, each focusing on different mathematical concepts and requiring varying levels of problem-solving skills.

### Problem Sets

- **[Project Euler Problems 1 to 100](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/project-euler/#project-euler-problems-1-to-100):**  
  In this set, I solve problems using mathematical concepts like the Fibonacci sequence, prime number theory, and combinatorics. The focus is on developing efficient algorithms.

- **[Project Euler Problems 101 to 200](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/project-euler/#project-euler-problems-101-to-200):**  
  Building on the previous set, these problems involve more advanced concepts such as vector computation, Pascal's pyramid, and the RSA algorithm.

- **[Project Euler Problems 201 to 300](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/project-euler/#project-euler-problems-201-to-300):**  
  This set delves into concepts like the binomial theorem, Hamming numbers, and the Collatz sequence, continuing the development of mathematical and problem-solving skills.

- **[Project Euler Problems 301 to 400](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/project-euler/#project-euler-problems-301-to-400):**  
  In these problems, I explore topics like combinatorial game theory, bitwise operations, and Golomb's self-describing sequence to create efficient solutions.

- **[Project Euler Problems 401 to 480](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/project-euler/#project-euler-problems-401-to-480):**  
  The final set requires the application of everything learned so far, tackling complex problems using advanced concepts like unitary divisors and the Kaprekar routine.

## How to Use This Repository

Each problem is solved using a variety of programming techniques and languages, with a focus on clarity and efficiency. The solutions are organized by problem set, and each problem has its own directory containing the solution file and any necessary auxiliary files.

### Structure
- **In Progress**
    - `ProblemSet1-100/`  
- **To Be Added**
    - `ProblemSet101-200/`  
    - `ProblemSet201-300/`  
    - `ProblemSet301-400/`  
    - `ProblemSet401-480/`

Each directory contains:

- **Solution Code:** The code implementing the solution.
